# Graphs
A graph is a data structure for storing connected data

## Challenge
1. AddNode()<br/>
2. AddEdge()<br/>
3. GetNodes()<br/>
4. GetNeighbors()<br/>
5. Size()<br/>

## Approach & Efficiency
Took a approach referring to the reading material

## API
1. AddNode()<br/>
Adds a new node to the graph. Takes in the value of that node. Returns the added node
2. AddEdge()<br/>
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph. Include the ability to have a “weight”. Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
3. GetNodes()<br/>
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
4. GetNeighbors()<br/>
Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node. Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
5. Size()<br/>
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
