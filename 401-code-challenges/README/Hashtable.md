# Challenge Summary
Implement a Hashtable.

## Challenge Description
1. Create a add method that takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. Create a get method that takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. Create a contains method that takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. Create a hash method that takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
Started with a whiteboard and used it as a reference to complete the code.
