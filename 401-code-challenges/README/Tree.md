# Lab 15: Trees
Implement a Tree

## Featured Task

### Create a Node class
A Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node was created.

### Create a BinaryTree Class
A method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an arraylist of the values, ordered appropriately was created.

### Create a BinarySearchTree class
1. A method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree was created.
2. A method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once was created.

### Approach & Efficiency
All test passed.

### API
1. preOrder method, inOrder, postOrder returns a arraylist in appropriate order.
2. add method accepts a value and adds a new node with that value to correct location
3. contains method accepts a value and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
