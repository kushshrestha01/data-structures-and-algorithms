# Challenge Summary
Writing a method for different type of Linked list insertions.

## Challenge Description
1. A function append takes in an int value and appends it to the end of the linked list . <br/>
2. A function insertBefore which takes target value and new value and adds a new node with the given newValue immediately before the target value node . <br/>
3. A function insertAfter which takes target value and new value and adds a new node with 
the given newValue immediately after the target value node . <br/>
