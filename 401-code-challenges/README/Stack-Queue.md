# Lab 10: Stack and Queue

## Stacks and Queues
Implementing a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

### Challenge
1. Creating a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
2. Creating a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
3. Defining a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
4. Defining a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
5. Defining a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
6. Creating a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
7. Defining a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
8. Defining a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
9. Defining a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.

### Approach & Efficiency
All test passed.

### API
1. In Stack class push method takes int value and add it to the stack, pop method removes the top node and method peek returns the top value
2. In Queue class enqueue method takes int value and add it to the queue, Method dequeue removes the node from the front of the queue and return its value and peek method returns the value located in the front of the queue
