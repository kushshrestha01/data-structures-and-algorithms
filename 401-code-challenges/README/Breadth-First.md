# Challenge Summary - Class 17
Create a Breadth-first Traversal

## Challenge Description
1. A method called fizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument and without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
2. If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
3. If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
4. If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
5. Return the tree with its new values.

## Approach & Efficiency
Started with a whiteboard and used it as a reference to complete the code.
