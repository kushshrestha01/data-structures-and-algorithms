# Lab 05: Linked Lists

## Singly Linked List
Implementing a Singly Linked List Data Structure

### Challenge
1. Createing a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
2. Defining a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
3. Defining a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
4. Defining a method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

### Approach & Efficiency
All test passed.

### API
1. Insert methods creates a new node and assign the value
   ``insert(int value)
2. Includes methods checks for any duplicate value
3. Print methods returns a Arraylist will all the values in the linkedlist
